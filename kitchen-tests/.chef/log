[2015-05-18T12:51:04-07:00] WARN: Chef-client has been configured to audit after it converges. Audit mode is an experimental feature currently under development. API changes may occur. Use at your own risk.
* To enable audit mode after converge, use command line option `--audit-mode enabled` or set `:audit_mode = :enabled` in your config file.
* To disable audit mode, use command line option `--audit-mode disabled` or set `:audit_mode = :disabled` in your config file.
* To only run audit mode, use command line option `--audit-mode audit-only` or set `:audit_mode = :audit_only` in your config file.
Audit mode is disabled by default.
